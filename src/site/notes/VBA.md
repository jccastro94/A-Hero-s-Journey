Take out any other software and a competitor sweeps in, but take out Excel, and the industry grinds to a stop and shatters into pieces. Although these companies are slowly migrating their data to the cloud, in more resilient formats such as SQL databases or even csv files, they are still dependant on Excel. 

8 out 10 times, an automation process that needs to be done, can be done in an Excel macro, without the need of any new expensive RPA system.
